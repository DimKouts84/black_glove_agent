# Black Glove Security Policies

## Overview

This document outlines the security policies, safety controls, and ethical guidelines that govern the Black Glove pentest agent. These policies are designed to ensure responsible use, prevent misuse, and maintain the integrity of the security testing process.

## Legal and Ethical Framework

### Responsible Use Policy
Black Glove is designed exclusively for authorized security testing of systems you own or have explicit written permission to test. By using this tool, you agree to:

1. **Authorization**: Only test systems you own or have documented permission to test
2. **Compliance**: Adhere to all applicable local, national, and international laws
3. **Ethics**: Use findings solely for improving security, not for malicious purposes
4. **Disclosure**: Report critical vulnerabilities to appropriate parties responsibly
5. **Liability**: Accept full responsibility for your actions and their consequences

### Prohibited Activities
The following activities are strictly prohibited:

- Testing systems without explicit authorization
- Using the tool for malicious or criminal purposes
- Attempting to bypass the built-in safety controls
- Sharing exploit code or detailed attack methodologies
- Conducting high-volume scanning without proper rate limiting
- Targeting critical infrastructure without special authorization

## Safety Controls

### First-Run Legal Notice
**Mandatory Requirement**: All users must acknowledge the legal notice on first run.

```

### Human-in-the-Loop Approval
All active scanning and high-risk operations require explicit human approval:

- **Passive Recon**: Automatic (no approval required)
- **Active Scanning**: Typed approval required
- **Exploit Tools**: Lab mode + typed approval required
- **High-Risk Operations**: Multiple confirmation steps

### Rate Limiting
Built-in rate limiting prevents accidental denial-of-service:

- **Default**: 50 packets/requests per second
- **Configurable**: User-defined limits in configuration
- **Enforcement**: Policy engine blocks excessive rates
- **Per-Tool**: Different limits for different tools

### Container Sandboxing
All security tools run in isolated Docker containers:

- **Network Isolation**: Controlled network access
- **File System**: Read-only root filesystem where possible
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory constraints
- **Timeouts**: Automatic termination of long-running processes

### Private Network Protection
Prevents accidental scanning of unauthorized networks:

- **Allow List**: Only scan explicitly defined assets
- **Private Range Blocking**: Blocks 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16
- **Loopback Protection**: Blocks localhost scanning by default
- **Custom Ranges**: Configurable private network definitions

## Lab Mode Controls

### Exploit Tool Gating
High-risk exploit tools require special conditions:

```
Requirements for exploit tools:
├── Lab Mode Flag: --lab-mode or LAB_MODE=true
├── Explicit Approval: Typed "yes" confirmation
├── Isolated Environment: Non-production network
├── Time-based Lockout: 24-hour cooldown period
└── Audit Logging: Detailed action recording
```

### Environment Verification
Lab mode performs environment checks:

- **Network Isolation**: Verifies non-production network
- **Asset Validation**: Confirms lab asset targeting
- **Permission Checks**: Validates user authorization
- **Safety Confirmation**: Additional warning prompts

## Data Security

### Database Protection
SQLite database security measures:

- **File Permissions**: User-only read/write access
- **Path Protection**: Stored in user home directory
- **Backup Encryption**: Optional encrypted backups
- **Access Control**: Application-only database access

### Evidence Storage
Raw tool output handling:

- **Integrity Verification**: SHA256 checksums for all evidence
- **Organized Storage**: Asset-based directory structure
- **Retention Policy**: Configurable cleanup schedules
- **Access Logging**: Audit trail of evidence access

### Configuration Security
Configuration file protection:

- **File Permissions**: User-only access
- **Sensitive Data**: No hardcoded credentials
- **Environment Variables**: External secret management
- **Validation**: Configuration schema validation

## Audit and Logging

### Immutable Audit Trail
All actions are logged with the following schema:

```json
{
  "ts": "2025-08-18T15:23:01Z",
  "actor": "user",
  "event_type": "approval",
  "data": {
    "asset_id": 3,
    "step_id": 12,
    "approved_by": "username",
    "approval_method": "typed_yes"
  }
}
```

### Log Retention
Audit log management:

- **Default Retention**: 2 years for audit logs
- **Evidence Retention**: 90 days for raw outputs
- **Compression**: Automatic compression of older logs
- **Backup**: Optional external backup configuration

### Log Integrity
Audit log protection:

- **Append-Only**: No modification of existing entries
- **Checksums**: Integrity verification for log files
- **External Storage**: Optional cloud backup integration
- **Tamper Detection**: Automatic integrity checking

## Network Security

### Connection Controls
Network access restrictions:

- **Outbound Only**: No listening sockets
- **Whitelisted Endpoints**: Only approved external services
- **Proxy Support**: Configurable proxy settings
- **Timeout Handling**: Automatic connection timeouts

### Data Transmission
Network data handling:

- **Local Processing**: Maximum local data processing
- **Minimal Exposure**: Only necessary data transmitted
- **Encryption**: TLS for all external connections
- **Compression**: Compressed transmission where beneficial

## Input Validation

### Two-Layer Sanitization
All tool inputs undergo rigorous validation:

**Layer 1: Allow-list Validation**
```python
# Example: IP address validation
if not re.match(r'^\d{1,3}(\.\d{1,3}){3}$', target):
    raise ValueError(f"Invalid target format: {target}")
```

**Layer 2: Parameterized Commands**
```python
# Safe command building
cmd = ['nmap', '-sS', '--top-ports', '100', target]
# Never: f"nmap -sS {target}" (vulnerable to injection)
```

### Output Sanitization
Tool output processing:

- **LLM Filtering**: LLM analyst removes sensitive information
- **Redaction**: Automatic removal of credentials
- **Validation**: Output schema validation
- **Encoding**: Proper encoding for display

## Error Handling Security

### Failure Containment
Error handling security measures:

- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues on non-critical failures
- **Sensitive Data Protection**: No stack traces in user output
- **Logging Separation**: Detailed logs vs user-friendly messages
- **Recovery Procedures**: Automatic cleanup on failure

### LLM Safety
LLM interaction security:

- **Prompt Injection Protection**: Input sanitization for LLM prompts
- **Output Validation**: Verification of LLM responses
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Manual processing when LLM fails
- **Hallucination Detection**: Response consistency checking

## Access Controls

### User Authentication
User identity management:

- **Single User**: Designed for individual operator use
- **System Integration**: Uses system user context
- **Session Management**: Process-based session handling
